# The Eurovision allocator
Sometimes, when amping up for Eurovision, there are simply too many acts to keep track of. If throwing a Eurovision party with friends, it can be fun to have certain countries to support, despite having no ties to it, to result in some friendly competition between friends. 

This web app helps, and will allocate out acts for as many people as needed. 

Let me know if you have any problems or if anything is unintuitive.
